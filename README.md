Welcome to ERD Maker, a web application that... well, helps you make ERDs ([Entity - Relationship Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model)).

Free and open-source, this tool features an editor "armed" with every tool necessary to design an ERD.

Additionally, account registration is available, allowing users to save up to 25 diagrams on the cloud and view or work on them from any place and device (even mobile).

Diagrams can be exported as .jpg images or as stand-alone files for local storage and then be imported at any time, even by different accounts.

Feel free to try this application on the [main site](https://erdmaker.com).

Below you can see a sample diagram made with this tool.
